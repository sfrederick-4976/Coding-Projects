The projects within this repository were created as projects and assignments for university classes.  They contain learning and growing and the growth of code quality and organization can be seen throughout the code.  

## WebApplication-React
### Following The Travel Bug
This appication was created as a web application.  It contains lorum ipsum text and any code that was used that was not origional is included in the citations within the file.  It is the first project that I used React and there are still improvements that I would like to make as it is an ongoing process.  This application shows the use of React as well as a no-SQL database which is Firebase in this instance.    

To run the code, "npm start" will start the local server.  Alternatively, For a preview of this application, it can be found at https://following-the-travel-bug.web.app/


## PHP-Example
This assignment was my final project for a course that used php.  The database has since been deleted therefore the connection will not be functional.  However, this application shows the usage of PHP within a web application as well as the growth of php from the beginning to the end of the application.  This also shows the use of SQL within a web application.  

## Python-Example
This assignment, though not related to web development, was designed to crack a simple password that is input into a login system.  It shows my compitency with Python and problem solving.
