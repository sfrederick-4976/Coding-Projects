# Following the Travel Bug App
This project was created for CSCI 3172 in Fall 2020.  It is an e-commerce and commuinty site for people to gather and 
share ideas, tips and lessons about van life as well as an opportunity to buid and design their dream van.  

This idea originated from my personal love of van life and my frustration with the inability to find a company that can
help build out a van or even source a reasonable second hand van and its' equipment in the maritimes.  The closest is 
Quebec then there is a great on in Ohio that is well priced if you make American dollars but the conversion is financially
not a good investment.

##Instructions to run:
#### `Introduction`
This application is built using primarily React.  Its backend is built using Node.js and many functions and features 
including the database and authentication system use Firebase tools.  

#### `To Run`
To run the application locally, "npm start" will start the local server which should run on localhost:3000. 

#### `Features`
The following pages are included in the application submission.  They page names are followed by their url path.  
 -   Home page      ('/')
 -   Who We Are     ('/whoWeAre')
 -   What We Do     ('/whatWeDo')
 -   How It Works   ('/howItWorks')
 -   Shop           ('/shop')
 -   Community      ('/community')
 -   Registration   ('/signUp)
 -   Login          ('/login)
 -   Admin Dash     ('/adminDash')
 -   Product Detail ('/product')
 -   Cart           ('/cart')
 -   Payment        ('/payment')
 -   Partners Page  ('/partners')
 -   Contact Us     ('/contactUs')
 
 These pages contain mostly lorum ipsum text for text content and images are all off of instagram and Pinterest boards. 
 
 
 #### `Incomplete or For Future Development`
 
 These features are portions that I would have liked to have had completed for this Milestone or features that I would 
 ideally like to develop for future use of this application for portfolio use
 - Forgot Password Page and Functionality (function created)
 - Change Password Page and Functionality (function created)
 - Profile page
 - A database of products to populate the Shop page, so it's not just one product
 - Further backend interaction
 - Careers Page
 - Role based authentication
 - Functional Admin Dashboard
 
 The reason many of these functions and pages were not implemented was because learning React took far longer than 
 anticipated and the many resources available ended up with a lot of backtracking and re-creating certain components to 
 function in all the ways necessary.
