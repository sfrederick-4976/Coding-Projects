### Python Password Hacking

This assignment was to hack a random password that was given that could contain lower case letters, numbers, or whitespace.  It also had to indicate how long the crack takes.  The password had to be 5 characters in length.  Though this task could have been more challenging with a different number of characters or added letters, the solution could have been similar, with more indepth logic.
